# KIPP Android App
[Codepath](http://codepath.com/) android bootcamp final project created in 3 weeks for
[Kipp charter schools](http://www.kipp.org/). The app's target user is teachers.
With the app, teachers can:
* log good and bad behavior events against students
* view trends in student behavior
* view recommended actions to take on individual students
* interact with students/parents in response to student behavior
* track behavior points for students, which can be redeemed for field trips, early recess, and
other privileges
